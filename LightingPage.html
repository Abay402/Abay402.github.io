        <h3>2D Lighting System in GameMaker</h3>
        
        
        <p id="about">
            I worked on this system as I had an idea for a 2D roguelike that I wanted to make in GameMaker and I really want the art and colours to stand out in the game and the lighting helps that.
                
        </p>

        <p id="about">
            
            The lighting system uses multiple shaders that I created to create the light effect and the lighting controller object controls the lighting for every light in the game.
            I also wanted the system to be extremely fast and efficient and about roughly 1000 lights can be placed and in the viewport at once before the frames drop below 60. 
            Within the editor the colour, size, direction, angle, and strength of the light can be changed. 
            The lighting shader also makes it so the colour of the light blends in with the colour of the tiles and objects in the game seamlessly.
