        <h3>About Me</h3>
    
        <p id="about"> 
            My name is Abayjit Sidhu and I am a game developer. Developing games started 
            as a hobby for me when I was around 15 years old but has since turned into an actual career.
            I attended Humber College in Toronto for 3 years and graduated with honours in the Game Programming program.
            Since graduating I've spent time working on small projects and tools while I search for my 
            first job within the industry. 
        </p>

        <p id="about">

            As a junior game developer I am always learning new skills and ways to design code more effectively.
            I try to develop games with the mindset that innovation is extremely important in making a good game.
            I also believe that developers should have fun playing the games their making.
            In terms of coding, I believe that smart, clean, and efficient code are the keys to success.

        </p>

        <p id="about">
            I have been playing video games my entire life and I understand just how important games are to people.
            With every project I work on, I will always try to use my skills in different engines and multiple coding languages
            to create fun gameplay experiences for players.
