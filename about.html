                <p class="about"> 
                    My name is Abayjit Sidhu and I am a game developer. Developing games started 
                    as a hobby for me when I was around 15 years old but has since turned into an actual career.
                    I attented Humber College in Toronto for 3 years and graduated with honours in the Game Programming program.
                    Since graduating I've spent time working on small projects and tools while I search for my 
                    first job within the industry.

                <p class="about">

                    As a junior game developer I am always learning new skills and ways to design code more effectively.
                    I try to develop games with the mindset that innovation is extremely important in making a good game.
                    I also believe that developers should have fun playing the games their making.
                    In terms of coding, I believe that smart, clean, and efficient code are the keys to success.

                </p>

                <p class="about">
                    I have been playing video games my entire life and I understand just how important games are to people.
                    With every project I work on, I will always try to use my skills in different engines and multiple coding languages
                    to create fun gameplay experiences for players.
