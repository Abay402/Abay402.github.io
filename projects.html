                <h5 class="headerDiv">Sky City Fugitive</h5>
    
                <p>Sky City Fugitive is a prototype that I made on my own for my Capstone project for Humber's Game Programming Program. The goal of this demo is ​to showcase the three main systems; the dialogue system, the soulslike respawning system, and the event system. I made this project in Unreal Engine 5 despite it being a 2D game because I wanted to challenge myself and to learn how to do it effectively. I also made all of the character art in the game including the animations.</p>

                <h5 class="headerDiv">2D Battleship Game</h5>
    
                <p>I made this project alongside two others for an AI course in Humber's Game Programming Program. The goal of this project was to learn and correctly implement steering, pathfinding, and decision making AI. I worked on the steering and decision making and I believe I implemented the AI correctly and effectively.</p>

                <p>I made this project alongside three others for my Midstone project for Humber's Game Programming Program. The goal of this project was to learn and use a SDL framework and learn how to work within a team. I worked on the player movement, the projectile system and the power up system.</p>
